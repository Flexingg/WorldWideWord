WordWideWeb 🌍📖A lightning-fast, offline-first Bible Reader built on the web platform.📱 Live Demo: https://flexingg.github.io/WordWideWeb/🚀 OverviewWordWideWeb is a high-performance Single Page Application (SPA) designed for distraction-free Bible study. Unlike traditional apps that rely on heavy databases and backend servers, WordWideWeb utilizes a "Static API" architecture.It treats a standard file system (Markdown text and MP3 audio) as a database, fetching content on-demand and rendering it client-side. This ensures zero latency, complete privacy, and full offline capability.✨ Key Features📖 Reading ExperienceMarkdown Parsing: Renders clean, formatted text from raw Markdown files.Material 3 Design: A modern, expressive UI that adapts to Light and Dark modes.Auto-Scroll: Hands-free reading with variable speed control.Lexicon Integration: Instant definitions for Strong's numbers (e.g., [[H1234]]).🎧 Virtual Audio TimelineSeamless Playback: Stitches multiple audio files (verses/parts) into a continuous "Virtual Timeline."Smart Scrubber: A custom waveform scrubber that represents the entire chapter's duration, even if the audio is split into multiple physical files.Background Playback: Audio continues playing while you browse the library.💾 Local-First DataPersistent Highlights: Highlight verses or individual words in 5 different colors.Private Notes: Write study notes attached to specific chapters.History: Tracks your recent reading.Zero Cloud Dependency: All user data is stored in the browser's localStorage.🔍 SearchClient-Side Indexing: Performs lightning-fast searches using a pre-generated JSON index of the entire text.🏗️ Technical ArchitectureThe application is built with Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) and CSS Variables, requiring no build frameworks (React/Vue) or bundlers.The "Static API" ConceptInstead of querying a SQL database, the app requests static files via fetch():Text: bibles/BSB/BER-Genesis/Genesis 1.mdAudio: bibles/BSB/BER-Genesis/Audio/Genesis 1/part_0.mp3Definitions: lexicon/H1234.mdDirectory StructureTo deploy your own instance, organize your repository exactly as follows:/ (root)

🗺️ Development RoadmapWe are actively developing new features. Here is the priority list:Phase 1: Core Enhancements (Static / GitHub Pages)Reading Plans: * Description: A dashboard where users can subscribe to JSON-based reading plans (e.g., "Bible in a Year") hosted in the repo. The app tracks progress locally.Deep Linking: * Description: Support for URL routing (e.g., .../index.html#Genesis_1) to allow sharing direct links to specific chapters.Font & Theme Customization: * Description: A settings menu to adjust font face (Serif/Sans), size, and line height, along with expanded theme options (OLED Black, Sepia).Swipe Gestures: * Description: Horizontal swipe detection on the reader view to seamlessly navigate to the previous or next chapter.Installation Prompts: * Description: A custom UI element to encourage users to install the PWA on supported devices.Scroll Progress Bar: * Description: A subtle visual indicator at the top of the screen showing reading progress within the current chapter.Phase 2: Data & Analytics (Static / GitHub Pages)Backup & Restore: * Description: A tool to export all user data (highlights, notes, history) to a JSON file and restore it on another device.Reading Statistics: * Description: A visual dashboard showing streaks, chapters read, and time spent reading.Phase 3: Connected Features (Requires Backend)Social Features: * Description: Share highlights or notes with friends (requires external authentication and database services like Firebase).🛠️ Deployment & Maintenance1. Adding ContentText: Upload Markdown files to the bibles/ directory. Ensure headers use ###### VerseNumber format.Audio: Upload MP3 files to the corresponding Audio folder. Use sequential naming (part_0.mp3, part_1.mp3) for auto-chaining.2. Updating the Search IndexSince there is no backend server to run queries, the app relies on a client-side index. You must run the indexer script whenever you add new text files.Ensure you have Python 3 installed.Run the script from the root of the repo:python3 generate_index.py
This creates/updates data/search_index.json.Commit and push the new JSON file to GitHub.3. Hosting on GitHub PagesPush this code to a GitHub repository.Go to Settings > Pages.Select Source: Deploy from a branch.Select Branch: main (or master) and folder / (root).Save. Your PWA is now live globally.© 2025 WordWideWeb Project. Open Source.
